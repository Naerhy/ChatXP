# ChatXP

ChatXP is a very simple and lightweight addon to display your XP progress in chat when you login, complete a quest or enter the `/cxp` command.  
If you are at max level, nothing will be printed in chat.

I made this addon for my own purpose as I have disabled the XP bar on my WoW interface and still wanted to know my current progress.

TBC Classic ONLY!
